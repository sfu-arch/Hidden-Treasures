# üß™ Project Spec: Adding RISC-V AMM Matrix Instructions to xDSL

## üîç Overview

In this project, you'll extend the [**xDSL**](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl) compiler infrastructure to **support RISC-V AMM matrix multiply instructions**. You'll define new intermediate representations (IRs), implement instruction parsing and verification, and build a simple **software emulator** that mimics the execution of matrix instructions like `mmul`, `macc`, `loadm`, and `storem`.

## üîß What is xDSL?

**xDSL** (eXtensible Domain-Specific Language) is a Python-based compiler infrastructure that mimics [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/), a modern framework for building reusable and composable compiler components.

* xDSL provides a set of **dialects** ‚Äî namespaces that define operations like arithmetic, control flow, or memory.
* Each operation is modeled as a Python class with input **operands**, output **results**, and optional **attributes**.
* Dialects can be used to represent hardware-specific instructions, which you will do for RISC-V AMM.

## üß© IRs, Dialects, and ISAs: Similarities and Differences

| Concept     | Description                                                              | Example                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **IR**      | A compiler's internal, structured representation of a program            | `%a = addi %x, %y : i32`   |
| **Dialect** | A collection of operations/types that define a specific domain in the IR | `arith`, `memref`, `riscv` |
| **ISA**     | A specification of hardware instructions executed by a processor         | `addi x1, x2, 5` (RISC-V)  |

* **IR**: Abstract representation ‚Äî architecture-agnostic and often typed.
* **Dialect**: Namespaces within the IR for grouping related operations (e.g., math or hardware-specific).
* **ISA**: The real, binary instruction set a processor decodes and runs.

This project builds a **RISC-V AMM dialect** in the IR, which lets us model matrix instructions before they are lowered to actual RISC-V machine code.

---

## ü§î What is an IR?

An **Intermediate Representation (IR)** is how compilers represent programs internally. It‚Äôs a structured way of describing computation that sits between high-level source code (like Python or C) and low-level machine instructions.

* IRs allow compilers to perform **optimizations** and **transformations**.
* In xDSL, IRs look like typed assembly, e.g.:

  ```mlir
  %c = const 0 : i32
  %a = loadm %ptr : memref<4x4xf32>
  %b = loadm %ptr2 : memref<4x4xf32>
  %r = mmul %a, %b : matrix<4x4xf32>
  ```

## üè† RISC-V AMM Instructions

The **RISC-V Architected Matrix Multiply (AMM)** extension adds fixed-shape matrix ops to accelerate AI workloads:

| Instruction | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `loadm`     | Load matrix from memory             |
| `storem`    | Store matrix to memory              |
| `mmul`      | Matrix multiplication (`C = A √ó B`) |
| `macc`      | Matrix accumulate (`C += A √ó B`)    |

### üÜò Getting Help and Resources

**When You're Stuck:**
1. **Read the error message carefully** - xDSL provides detailed error messages
2. **Check existing examples** - Look at similar operations in other dialects
3. **Use Python debugger** - Add `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` to debug
4. **Ask specific questions** - Don't just say "it doesn't work"

**Additional Resources:**
- xDSL Documentation: [xdslproject.github.io](https://xdslproject.github.io/)
- MLIR Language Reference: [mlir.llvm.org/docs/LangRef/](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/LangRef/)
- Python Class Design: [Real Python OOP](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
- NumPy Documentation: [numpy.org/doc/](https://numpy.org/doc/)

**Time Management Tips:**
- **Budget 10-15 hours per week** for this project
- **Start early** - compiler projects often take longer than expected
- **Test frequently** - Don't write everything before testing
- **Document as you go** - Don't leave documentation until the end

## üö® Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### üîß Installation and Setup Problems

**Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xdsl'"**
```bash
# Solution: Make sure you're in the right directory and virtual environment
cd /path/to/xdsl
source xdsl-env/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
pip install -e .              # Install in development mode
python -c "import xdsl; print('Success!')"
```

**Issue: "Python version incompatible"**
```bash
# Solution: Check Python version and upgrade if needed
python --version  # Should be 3.10+
# If too old, install newer Python and recreate virtual environment
```

**Issue: "Permission denied" when running commands**
```bash
# Solution: Don't use sudo with pip in virtual environments
# Make sure you're in your virtual environment first
which python  # Should show path to venv, not system Python
```

### üêõ Common Coding Errors

**Error: "VerificationError: Operation does not match type signature"**
```python
# Problem: Operand types don't match what operation expects
# Check that you're passing the right types to operations

# Wrong:
matrix_val = SSAValue(IntegerType(32))  # This is an integer, not matrix!
mmul_op = MatrixMultiplyOp([matrix_val, matrix_val], [...])

# Right: 
matrix_val = SSAValue(MatrixType([4, 4], f32))  # Correct matrix type
mmul_op = MatrixMultiplyOp([matrix_val, matrix_val], [...])
```

**Error: "AttributeError: 'MatrixType' object has no attribute 'shape'"**
```python
# Problem: You haven't implemented all required methods/attributes
# Make sure your MatrixType has all the required fields

@irdl_attr_definition
class MatrixType(Data[MatrixType]):
    name = "riscv.matrix"
    shape: ParametrizedAttribute = param_def(ArrayAttr)  # Don't forget this!
    element_type: ParametrizedAttribute = param_def(Attribute)
```

**Error: "ParseError: Expected 'x' but found 'y'"**
```python
# Problem: Your parser doesn't match the syntax you're trying to parse
# Check that parse_parameters matches the syntax exactly

# If you want to parse: matrix<4x4xf32>
# Your parser should handle: '4', 'x', '4', 'x', 'f32'
```

### üß™ Testing Issues

**Issue: "Tests pass individually but fail when run together"**
- **Cause**: Global state or side effects between tests
- **Solution**: Make sure each test is independent, use fresh objects

**Issue: "ImportError in test files"**
- **Cause**: Python can't find your new modules
- **Solution**: Run tests from the xDSL root directory, check `__init__.py` files

**Issue: "Test coverage too low"**
- **Solution**: Add tests for error cases, edge cases, and all public methods

### üí° Design Decision Guidance

**Question: "Should matrices be fixed-size or variable-size?"**
- **Recommendation**: Start with fixed sizes (4x4, 8x8) to match RISC-V AMM spec
- **Future**: Can extend to variable sizes later

**Question: "What element types should I support?"**
- **Start with**: `f32` (32-bit float) and `i16` (16-bit integer)
- **Reasoning**: These are common in AI workloads and easy to test

**Question: "How detailed should verification be?"**
- **Minimum**: Check operand count, basic type compatibility
- **Recommended**: Also check matrix shape compatibility, element type matching
- **Advanced**: Check memory alignment, stride compatibility

### üìû When to Ask for Help

**Ask Immediately If:**
- You can't get the basic xDSL installation working after 2+ hours
- You're getting Python import errors that don't make sense
- The existing xDSL tests are failing on your machine

**Try for 1-2 Hours First:**
- Debugging your own code logic errors
- Understanding how existing xDSL operations work
- Writing test cases for your operations

**Research First, Then Ask:**
- How to implement specific language features
- Best practices for compiler design
- Performance optimization questions

### üéØ Project Scope Management

**Minimum Viable Project (if running short on time):**
- [ ] MatrixType with basic shape and element type
- [ ] MatrixMultiplyOp with verification
- [ ] Simple NumPy-based emulator for mmul
- [ ] Basic tests demonstrating functionality

**Full Project Scope:**
- [ ] All four operations (loadm, storem, mmul, macc)
- [ ] Complete parser and printer support
- [ ] Comprehensive verification logic
- [ ] Full software emulator with memory management
- [ ] Extensive test suite with edge cases

**Extension Ideas (if ahead of schedule):**
- [ ] Support for different matrix shapes (not just 4x4)
- [ ] Multiple element types (int8, int16, f16, f32)

- [ ] Integration tests show operations working together

**Documentation:**
- [ ] README explains how to run your code
- [ ] Example IR programs demonstrate all operations
- [ ] Technical report explains design decisions
